# Wirela_Air
Air quality device for CO2, VOC and temperature / humidity. Display and LED indicator for the measured values.

It is about measuring the indoor air. if there are many people in a room, the carbon dioxide content in the air increases. in 2020, the average carbon dioxide (Co2) content was 416.21 ppm. as new buildings are being built better and better and are becoming more and more heat-insulated and air-tight, our human output of Co2 in the air we breathe of up to 40,000 ppm always remains the same. this means that more active ventilation is required. who hasn't experienced this? Your friend wants to ventilate, but you don't? with a Co2 measuring device, clear limits can be defined when ventilation is necessary. if the Co2 value rises above 1000 ppm, ventilation should take place at the latest at 1200 ppm. The room air sensor Wirela Air has a built-in LED to indicate whether ventilation is necessary. if the LED is green, the air is good, <800 ppm, the LED is orange (>800ppm <1200ppm) should be ventilated. if the LED is red (>1200 ppm) must be ventilated. If the CO2 content in the air rises to more than 5000 ppm, a warning tone sounds and urgent ventilation is required. Co2 values >5000ppm can lead to fainting. 

In addition, it is planned that the VOC (volatile organic compounds) value of the air is measured. the VOC value is heard with various cleaning agents or among other things ethanol.
